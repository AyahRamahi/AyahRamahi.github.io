                    My name is Ayah Al-Ramahi. I am a computer engineering student in the University Of Jordan. I am interested in several
                    topics like: calligraphy, technolog, cyptography and computers. I loved programming and decided to study computer
                    engineering when I took an online course on <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edx</a> called 
                    <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a> offered by Harvard university. 
                    In my first year of university I started attending competitive programming trainings and participated in several ACM 
                    contests. I like  self-learning and I have a constant appetite for knowledge and experiments. In my free time I read 
                    books, wander with my friends exploring the world, improve my handwriting or surf the oceans of interesting fields 
                    in computer science and engineering.
